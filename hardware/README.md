# Proton Pack Hardware

# Hardware

The hardware consists of a capture system that records a data stream provided from a device under test (DUT) via a pair of coaxial cables.

# DUT hardware.

The signal from the DUT is sent from a standard FPGA GPIO pin to avoid requiring a transceiver. A transceiver would also work.
The signalling is HSTL-II to provide a fast signal rate of 1GBps or higher.

No termination is needed on the DUT. The transmission pair lines are wired simply to a pair of coax connectors.

On the receiving device the termination should be AC coupled into an MGT transceiver that is internally terminated.

It could also be directly connected as on the AC701 board.

# HDL 

The core design is in verilog. It's job is to serialize data and then deserialize the data and push it to memory and then to disk via the microprocessor system.

## Simulation

CVC64 is used for simulation.
